# C++ Dijkstra's Algorithm

This repository consists of a C++ project that implements Dijkstra's Algorithm for pathfinding, considering weighted nodes within an undirected graph.
The algorithm reads from a file called dijkstra2.in which has on it's first line the amount of nodes, the amount of edges and the start node.
It then reads the edges and the cost to travel from node X to node Y and vice-versa, and then writes to a file(dijkstra2.out) a shortest-path tree, consisting of the smallest costs from the source node to all the other nodes.
